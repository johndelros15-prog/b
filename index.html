          I just wanted to say thank you soo much for being an awesome friend. I know we've been friends for a while now, and I'm sooo grateful for the time you decided to be friends with me. You're literally the only woman who's treated me like a real friend, and I appreciate that a lot.

          I was thinking back to all the stuff we've done together, and there's just soo much to be thankful for. Like, remember those Roblox days? We had soo much fun playing those two-player obbies, especially <strong>Spider Obby WAHAHAHHA</strong>, And also the jokes are the best! Thanks for making me laugh, for being there, and for being you.
        </p>

          Christmas was way more fun with you, and I'm so glad we got to celebrate together. From decorating trees to exchanging gifts, though we didn't exchange gifts cuz we didn't draw each other or our names, also those crazy food trips. Can't wait for this new year with everyone—especially you!
